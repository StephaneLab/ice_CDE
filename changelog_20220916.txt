* Worked on an iconset to provide some CDE icons to PCManFM. Iconset originates from CDE desktop and have been brought in .png format by Arenyart (Andrew Enyart, USA). See https://www.gnome-look.org/p/1120392/ for the original theme.
Mainly copied icons and renamed some others to be freedesktop compliant. Modified the theme script to work with Gtk apps. The result is ok for the icons but the navigating arrows are not ok. The iconset can be downloaded there : https://github.com/StephaneLab/CDE-Gtk-Iconset
* Added two wallpapers under CC0 in the theme background directory and removed previous bg.png tile.
* Fixed a problem of font for the clock applet
* Bitstream Vera Serif Roman is a good font for the GTK menus.
* Added time between clics for double clic
* Added blinking cursor for xterm
* Removed the italic option for menu font and windows titlebar font
* Added a menu_en(english) and menu_fr(french) to copy in your ~/.icewm/menu to get a basis for a menu which is freedesktop compliant.
* Made the icons and font a little bigger in the menu
* Comes now in 3 colors schemes for Icewm
