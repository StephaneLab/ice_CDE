# IceWM Themes : ice_CDE

The IceWM window manager is really versatile and easily themable and configurable. A few such scripts can be downloaded from the https://www.box-look.org/ Themes page.

This repository contains a theme based on a former theme names FMotif from Alexander Voigt which I found on the page : https://www.box-look.org/p/1018167/

First inspired by the HP-UX workstations look and CDE (Common Desktop Manager) based on the Motif toolkit, this project has evolved and is now proposed in 4 colors schemes for icewm. It has been enhanced following some discussions with missTell on Box-Look.org in september/october 2022.

The icontheme is by ** missTell (2022) ** who gently accepted to structure a real state of the art Gtk iconset from icons coming from former KDE iconset.
Webpage of the iconset : https://www.pling.com/p/1920644/

Desktop icon inspired by <a href="https://www.flaticon.com/free-icons/glasses" title="glasses icons">Glasses icons created by Those Icons - Flaticon</a>

Some resources :
* The excellent CDE icon theme by missTell : https://www.pling.com/p/1920644
* josvanr's Gtk themes which mimic the Motif toolkit for the Default color scheme and the Crimson color scheme :
