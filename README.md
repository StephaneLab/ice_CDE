# IceWM Theme : ice_ux

The IceWM window manager is really versatile and easily themable and configurable. A few such scripts can be downloaded from the https://www.box-look.org/ Themes page.

This repository contains a theme based on a former theme names FMotif from Alexander Voigt which I found on the page : https://www.box-look.org/p/1018167/

This theme is inspired by the HP-UX workstations look and CDE (Common Desktop Manager) based on the Motif toolkit. I has evolved and is not proposed in 3 colors schemes.

Some resources :
* Icewm start buttons to copy as start.xpm in the ~/.icewm/themes/ICE_UX/taskbar theme directory :
https://github.com/ItzSelenux/icewm-menu-buttons

* josvanr's Gtk themes which mimic the Motif toolkit :
https://github.com/josvanr/cde-motif-theme
You will find also backdrops for your root background screen in the cde themes, I picked one from this work to provide a default background.

* Icewm widget style has been switched to metal, and colors have been verified and updated
* Xft support is required but it can work without, however in this case, I have not found good enough fonts yet
* A simple configuration file for conky is included and can be copied as ~/.conkyrc
* Some X resources for your ~/.Xresources are available inside the ice_ux directory, file .../ice_ux/Xresources
* And some configuration and menu files for icewm in the tar.gz file.

Hope the updated version will please you,
