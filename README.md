# IceWM Themes : ice_CDE

The IceWM window manager is really versatile and easily themable and configurable. A few such scripts can be downloaded from the https://www.box-look.org/ Themes page.

This repository contains a theme based on a former theme names FMotif from Alexander Voigt which I found on the page : https://www.box-look.org/p/1018167/

First inspired by the HP-UX workstations look and CDE (Common Desktop Manager) based on the Motif toolkit, this project has evolved and is now proposed in 4 colors schemes for icewm. It has been enhanced following some discussions with missTell on Box-Look.org in september/october 2022.

The icontheme is by ** missTell (2022) ** who gently accepted to structure a real state of the art Gtk iconset from icons coming from former KDE iconset.


Some resources :
* Icewm start buttons to copy as start.xpm in the ~/.icewm/themes/ICE_UX/taskbar theme directory :

For the Default color theme :
* josvanr's Gtk themes which mimic the Motif toolkit :

See the changelog for an idea of the maturation of the project.

Hope the updated version will please you,
