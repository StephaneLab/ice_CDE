IceWM Theme

The IceWM window manager is really versatile and easily themable and configurable. A few such scripts can be downloaded from the https://www.box-look.org/ Themes page.

This repository contains a theme based on a former theme names FMotif from Alexander Voigt which I found on the page : https://www.box-look.org/p/1018167/

This theme is inspired by the HP-UX workstations look and CDE (Common Desktop Manager) based on the Motif toolkit.

Some resources :
* Icewm start buttons to copy as start.xpm in the ~/.icewm/themes/ICE_UX/taskbar theme directory :
https://github.com/ItzSelenux/icewm-menu-buttons

* Gtk themes which mimic the Motif toolkit :

* Some X resources for your ~/.Xresources are available inside the ice_ux directory, file .../ice_ux/Xresources-icewm-theme
